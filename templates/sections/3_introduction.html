        <p class="lead"><i class='notranslate'>Free Queue Manager.</i> Web based management 
        system developed for the purpose of easing the process of organizing queues and lines. Like many other
        queue management systems, this system does provide a basic control panel that allow the users
        and customers alike to interact with it via a basic and simple user interface. Point that
        makes this system different from others, the fact it's free to use, modify and share.
        Which makes it a good alternative to the many expensive management systems.
        Moreover, The independent nature of this system,
        has influenced the development towards more independent IT solutions, that won't require you
        to be more dependant on specific operating system or hardware, instead finding new solutions that fits all.</p>

          The eight release has brought some improvements in features that were shipped in prior releases, as well as many fixes
          to defects that were introduced in the seventh release. Hopefully the recent increase of tests coverage from 48% to 80% will help
          us reduce the number of defects that tends to accompany new implementations. Database migration a feature we introduced in
          the seventh release, but wasn't fully functional across all platforms. With this release it's fully functional
          and stable. Another feature that were introduced earlier, and was improved in this release is text-to-speech announcement caching,
          major refactoring on that part of the code-base were done, to improve its stability and performance. Finally one of the nice
          additions in this release is the new Single row queuing interface.
