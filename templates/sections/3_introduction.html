        <p class="lead"><i class='notranslate'>Free Queue Manager.</i> Web based management 
        system developed for the purpose of easing the process of organizing queues and lines. Like many other
        queue management systems, this system does provide a basic control panel that allow the users
        and customers alike to interact with it via a basic and simple user interface. Point that
        makes this system different from others, the fact it's free to use, modify and share.
        Which makes it a good alternative to the many expensive management systems.
        Moreover, The independent nature of this system,
        has influenced the development towards more independent IT solutions, that won't require you
        to be more dependant on specific operating system or hardware, instead finding new solutions that fits all.</p>

          The last release has introduced many new features and improvements that were highly requested. Some of the features
          introduced in this release: Multiple Display and Touch Screens support based on offices. In previous releases we were bound
          to a Single Display and Touch screens but with this release the number of screens will be bound to the number of
          offices that will be created. Another highly requested feature is pulling a random ticket from a queue ticket within tasks
          or offices. Another most requested feature, is the ability to put an actively waiting ticket on-hold.
          On the side of fixes, Probably the most noticeable fix is, Implementing a caching mechanism to reduce
          the latency in generating the text-to-speech announcement to almost 0% latency.
